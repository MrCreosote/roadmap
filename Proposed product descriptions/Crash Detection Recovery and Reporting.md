Crash Detection, Recovery and Reporting Product Description

##Summary
Crash Detection, Recovery and Reporting has two high level objectives.   One is to improve the error messaging infrastructure to give the developer the ability to separate messages that should be displayed to the user from debug messages which are primarily useful to developers.  Objective two is to build a service which developers can use to track and debug issues in the services they have developed. 

+ Team lead: Dan O.

+ Team: Ryan, Bob, Harry, Tom

##Extended description
The error messaging infrastructure will allow developers to specify short error messages, which are clearly visible to the user and highlighted in the user interface with errors occur.  This effort will enhance the user interface by collapsing debug-like messages that are currently displayed, and a new display box will be created containing the short error message.  The developer messaging will be implemented by trapping errors that occur and storing them in a database.  There will be a web frontend created where developers can browse all the errors generated by their service.  The catalog service will be used to map developers to the SDK module that generated the error.  Developers will be able to enable/disable email notifications so they are notified when new error reports arrive.

##Timeline for feature release
+ January 19: deploy a prototype of CDRR error report button into narrative-ci
+ January 19: deploy a prototype of simple error viewer into narrative-ci
+ February 5: deploy a prototype of CDRR developer crash report portal into CI
+ February 19: create pull request for any updates necessary to SDK (documentation, error log libraries)
+ February 26: deploy CDRR to production

##User stories
+	User Mike runs a genome assembly SDK job.  During execution that backend worker crashes.  An error message saying "Lost connection with the backend worker, please try your job again".  Mike retries his assembly job, and this time it executes successfully.  

+	User Chris runs a metabolic model and the gapfilling step is unable to complete because of the complexity of the input data.  Since the developer anticipated this, this error is caught by the SDK run script and the error message "Unable to complete because of the complexity of the input data" appears.  Chris is presented with a report bug button in the user interface.  Chris pushes this report bug button, and enters a comment stating that these results are critical to his work on an important project.  A JIRA ticket is created, and the developer of this SDK method is notified.  In the notification email a link is presented to the develper to our site containing context and debug log information regarding the failed invocation of the metabolic model.
